# CSS 2

There are 4 boxes with `display: inline-block`on the page, with identical content and width set to 25% each.
From some reason one of them is wrapped to another line. Fix this problem so the page will look like on the `css_1.png` screen.

You can use whatever technique you want, but do not change `display` or `width` CSS property of the boxes. Keeping space between boxes is not necessary (they can "touch" each other).

Describe in CSS comment why you choosed such solution.
