# CSS 1

In this excercise you have to:

1. Change the look of the `index.html` page to look exactly like on the screenshot `css_1.png`
2. Boxes should have flexible width - when we shrink the browser window they should all get thinner, but with equal height adjusted to heighest of them in each row (`css_1_small.png`).
3. You can edit both `index.html` and `style.css` files, but keep in mind that the less changes you make in `index.html` file, the better. TBH, you can solve this problem without doing any changes in `index.html` file :)
4. You can use whatever technique you want, but it should work on the newest possible version of Google Chrome browser.
