# JS 1

1. Write a script using jQuery, which will be executed after page has loaded and do following things:
2. Get random number from http://www.random.org/ in range 0-10
3. Display that number on page and ask user to confirm it by typing the same number into form input and submitting it.
4. If the user submit the same number, the script will display "Correct! Getting new number in X seconds..." message on the page, where X is the previously generated number.
